## AlexNet_PyTorch

This Repository was created to classify flowers with AlexNet for my Junior Brother's Final Homework.

Before running the AlexNet, you need to split the **Flower_Datasets** to Train_DataSet and Val_DataSet by `split_data.py`.

In `train.py`, you can choose to use the pre_weights of AlexNet which will improve training speed and accuracy or not.

The Flower_Datasets contain daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers and tulips, you can download it with [https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz].

Also the pre_weights of AlexNet can be downloaded with
[https://download.pytorch.org/models/alexnet-owt-4df8aa71.pth].

**`Keep Learning!`**
